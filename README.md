# WhatsApp test bot

A simple boilerplate I made of WhatsApp chatbot
functionality using Flask and the Twilio API. 

This code is also part 1 of the tutorial series for step by implementation of Chatbots from scratch using python.

## Libraries Used
- python-aiml (use this specific fork for python 3 because the default aiml package has issues with python3.x
- flask
- sqlalchemy (this is to save chats into a database for text analysis later on)
- passlib (I prefer the encryption options over the werkzeug security that comes default with flask)
